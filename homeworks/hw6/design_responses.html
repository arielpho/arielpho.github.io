					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the ideal miliseconds for animations is 200-500 miliseconds based off of the qualities of the human brain. However mobile devices animations should be around 200-300ms. Something else I learned is that timing should be based on the size of the device since smaller screens mean they travel shorter distances.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the animations they included in the article as examples. I am a more visual person so it helped me visualize what they were saying in the text. I also liked the section about easing and when it should be used.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
