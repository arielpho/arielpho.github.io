						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I learned that the Bait and Switch involves tricking the user by making the outcome of their decision something unexpected, like starting an update when trying to close a popup window about said update. Another dark pattern is Forced Continuity, where users input their information for a free trial but have no opportunity to opt out or any easy way to cancel. This results in the card being charged when they cannot figure out or forget how to cancel the subscription. Similar other effects and the ones I mentioned are improving over time and users are becoming more aware.  </p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was providing specific examples of the types of dark patterns such as the popup windows that claim you are the 100,000 user on the site. I also enjoyed that they left the person who coined the term so that I might be able to learn more on the topic. At the end they also concluded some solutions which was to have a code of ethics, which is a nice way to address the problems described.  </p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "In late 2000s there was this huge wave of LinkedIn spamming our inbox with dozens of follow-up emails through our contacts to “expand our professional network” and the worse part was that they were virtually impossible to get out of. Thankfully, this pattern was recognized and presented in San Jose’s US District Court (Perkin v. LinkedIn, 2014) with the key issue being spam.

							This cost LinkedIn a class-action lawsuit with a penalty of $13 million."</p>
