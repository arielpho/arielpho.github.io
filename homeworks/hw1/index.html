      <h2>Part 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Something I learned from this article is a way to improve in design is to analyze design from apps I use. When using these apps I can take note of the information hierarchy or placements of elements and question why they are there. By analyzing the purposes I can learn more about design and integrate it into my own designs.</li>
        <li>My favorite part of this article is when they break down specific examples. For example the types of text in the text bars, such as Airbnb indicated "Try 'London'" to engage interest. It is a way to capture the audience's attention.</li>
        <li>"How might their use cases be different from yours? How does the design serve these use cases?"</li>
        <li>I score it a 7 because it was short but gave a good start to starting developing design skills.</li>
      </ul>
