						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that your audience plays a big role in what type of font you choose. For example, if your audience is children then more legible fonts are needed. Another example is that fonts for seniors need more accessibile with readibility and contrasting colors. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was determining how to pair fonts together. I am unfamilar with pairings and by default I usually just pick one font and resize it, which is my comfort zone. The example pictures were helpful in explaining some of the points about the recomendations made, and gave very interesting pairings that are still readable. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
