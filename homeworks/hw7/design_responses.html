							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that Gestalt have 4 key ideas: Emergence, Reification, Multi-Stability, Invariance. Brains can fill in the gaps of objects and match them with patterns in its memory. Grouping things together cause the elements to be seen as related.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed the different visial examples because they were simple and easy to understand. For example, they included a simple version of the "Common Region" and then a more fleshed out version on a website. This is good for giving the reader an easy example to grasp the concept and then a more detailed example in a website layout for ideas in practical use.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "We can use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information, organising content and decluttering layouts."</p>
