                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned about new design animations that were being implemented. Many designs feature a scroll with some type of ease in and out. There were also a lot of subtle bouncing after the different windows were pushed around or changed. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part was seeing the designs that utilized more colors than the minimalism of black and white. I enjoyed the Landing Page concept with the pinks. I also enjoyed the easygrow.io app preview with the slight shifts in the images to give a more 3D feel to the images.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the amount of easing and minimal effects used in the easygrow.io app preview. It feels like it delivers information in a readable way with easy to understand menus. The animations are nice and simple but effective to create interest for the user. The app is able to show the main information with a graphic associated in a large area, with pop up windows that can give more information if requested. The layout also follows existing design patterns so it is easy to intuitively navigate.  </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 4. The designs all were minimalists and most of the animations seemed more annoying to use in daily life with all their distracting effects? It was cool for the animation/video but I do not see how it would be efficient for a user or intuitive as many windows are hidden and needed to be pulled into view. It also had no words, so I was not sure what to make of it.  </p>
